Hi there, I'm Miffy.
After accidentally discovering that I am somewhat more furry than I previously thought, I created a Bluesky account where I can be a true animal on the internet without revealing my office sona.
I also wanted somewhere to share the odd thought or project that will otherwise be lost in a stream of questionable closeups of myself and shitposting about Jira.
So I'm channeling my inner 90s kid and bringing back the blog.

I swore off Wordpress long ago, and my irrational dislike of Ruby rules out working with Jekyll, so **Hugo** seems to be a fine choice.
There's not a lot to this post, which is a good thing; setting up a blog in 2025 *should* be painless.

I compiled Hugo, made a Github repo, setup a Github action, fucked up my DNS, and pow: a blog fit for a bun.

We've got everything we need right out of the box[^1]!:

[^1]: We've got footnotes, made you look!

```python
def we_got(code_blocks):
  """wow, syntax highlighting."""
  print("nice!")
```

| Yes | sir |

I can <abbr title="abbreviate">abbr</abbr>, I can <mark>highlight</mark>, I for some reason can press <kbd>ANY</kbd> key!

So with that technical demonstration out of the way, welcome to my carrot patch.
